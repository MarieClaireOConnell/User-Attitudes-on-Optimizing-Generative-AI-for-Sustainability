# User-Attitudes-on-Optimizing-Generative-AI-for-Sustainability
User Attitudes on Optimizing Generative AI for Sustainability Research Project


## Overview
The rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) presents serious environmental problems, particularly for energy and water use in data centers. This study investigates consumer knowledge of AI's environmental impact and readiness to embrace sustainable habits, which may include trade-offs such as performance limits, usage restrictions, or levies. It also investigates public attitudes about corporate accountability and regulatory efforts. A mixed-methods approach, including correlation analysis, Chi-Square tests, and sentiment analysis, was utilized to examine survey data from users with varied levels of AI proficiency. 
The findings suggest that, while AI acquaintance raises awareness of its environmental impact, it does not always lead to behavioral change. Users looking for energy-efficient AI technologies favor usage limitations, but the cost remains a hurdle. To solve this issue, we propose explicit environmental benchmarks, educational programs, and transparency in AI energy use. Collaboration between legislators and industry leaders is critical for developing regulations that promote both sustainability and technical advancements.

## Project Goals
The problem to be addressed by this study is the escalating environmental impact of artificial intelligence, particularly its contribution to climate change through increased energy consumption and water usage.

## Research Objectives
This study seeks to examine users' understanding of the environmental impact of AI, specifically with its energy consumption and water usage in data centers. It aims to evaluate the degree to which consumers are prepared to accept trade-offs, like performance constraints, usage limitations, or nominal levies, to facilitate energy-efficient AI solutions. The research also examines public perceptions of business responsibility in reducing AI's environmental impact and the extent of support for legislative solutions. Ultimately, it investigates the impact of users' familiarity with AI and renewable energy programs on their perceptions of sustainable AI practices.

## Research Questions
1.	How aware are users of the environmental impact of AI, particularly energy consumption and water usage in data centers?
2.	To what extent are users willing to accept trade-offs (e.g., performance limitations, usage restrictions, small fees) to support energy-efficient AI solutions?
3.	How does familiarity with AI and renewable energy initiatives affect users’ attitudes toward sustainable AI practices?
